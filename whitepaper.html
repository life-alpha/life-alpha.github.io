      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stem Cell Basics:</strong> The unique properties and classifications of stem cells.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical Applications:</strong> Current uses, ongoing research, and clinical trial outcomes.</li>

    </section>

    <!-- Types of Stem Cells -->
    <section>
      <h2>Types of Stem Cells</h2>

      <h3>1. Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs)</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Origin &amp; Properties:</strong> Derived from blastocysts in early-stage embryos, ESCs 
        are <em>pluripotent</em>, meaning they can differentiate into any cell type in the human body.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therapeutic Potential:</strong> Their broad differentiation potential makes them invaluable 
        for studying human development, disease modeling, and generating specialized tissues.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ethical &amp; Regulatory Considerations:</strong> ESC research is subject to strict regulations 
        and ethical debates due to the destruction of embryos required for their derivation.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Adult Stem Cells</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Location &amp; Multipotency:</strong> Found in specific tissues (e.g., bone marrow, adipose tissue, 
        dental pulp), these <em>multipotent</em> cells differentiate into related cell types.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Advantages:</strong> Fewer ethical concerns and lower risk of immune rejection when harvested 
        from a patient’s own body.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Challenges:</strong> Limited differentiation range compared to ESCs, as well as a lower 
        proliferation capacity that can reduce therapeutic scalability.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Breakthrough Discovery:</strong> Created by reprogramming adult somatic cells to an embryonic-like 
        pluripotent state—a groundbreaking achievement recognized with the 2012 Nobel Prize in Medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Benefits:</strong> iPSCs avoid many ethical issues tied to ESC use and can be patient-specific, 
        thus minimizing rejection risks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limitations:</strong> Reprogramming can introduce genetic instability. Ongoing research focuses 
        on optimizing safety and scalability for clinical use.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Current Applications -->
    <section>
      <h2>Current Applications</h2>

      <h3>1. Orthopedic Treatments</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Clinical Uses:</strong> Stem cell therapies are proving effective in conditions such as osteoarthritis, 
        bone injuries, and cartilage defects. They help regenerate worn cartilage and reduce joint inflammation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Key Outcomes:</strong> Enhanced pain management, improved functionality, reduced scar tissue formation, 
        and faster recovery times.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Neurological Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope of Potential:</strong> Studies show promise for Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, 
        and spinal cord injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mechanisms of Action:</strong> Replacement of damaged neural cells and paracrine effects 
        that reduce inflammation and promote neural regeneration.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Cardiovascular Disease</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Heart Repair:</strong> Stem cells can regenerate cardiomyocytes and reduce scar tissue following 
        myocardial infarction, with clinical trials indicating improvements in heart function and patient 
        quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Challenges &amp; Considerations:</strong> Ensuring long-term engraftment and avoiding arrhythmogenic 
        risks associated with cell misintegration are key research areas.
      </p>
    </section>
    <!-- Logistic Growth Model Section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Example: Logistic Growth Model in Stem Cell Expansion</h2>
      <p>
        In certain laboratory settings, the proliferation of stem cells can follow a logistic growth pattern.
        When populations are small, they grow exponentially, but growth slows as the cell population 
        approaches a carrying capacity (due to nutrient limitations, space constraints, etc.). This 
        behavior can be captured by the logistic growth equation.
      </p>

      <!-- Equation Section -->
      <div class="equation">
        <strong>Logistic Growth Equation:</strong>
        <br><br>
        \( \frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1 - \frac{N}{K}\right) \)
      </div>

      <p>
        Where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>N</em> is the cell population at time <em>t</em>.</li>
        <li><em>r</em> is the intrinsic growth rate.</li>
        <li><em>K</em> is the carrying capacity of the culture environment.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Graph Placeholder -->
      <figure>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Logistic+Growth+Curve+of+Stem+Cells" 
             alt="Logistic Growth Curve" style="max-width:100%;">
        <figcaption>
          Figure 1. Illustration of a logistic growth curve representing stem cell proliferation over time.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As the population (<em>N</em>) grows, it initially increases rapidly if <em>N</em> is well below <em>K</em>. 
        However, as <em>N</em> approaches <em>K</em>, growth rate tapers off, stabilizing around the carrying capacity. 
        This model helps researchers understand and optimize in vitro culture conditions for maximum yield 
        without overpopulating the culture environment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Challenges and Ethical Considerations -->
    <section>
      <h2>Challenges and Ethical Considerations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Safety and Efficacy:</strong> Risks include tumor formation and inconsistencies in manufacturing practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory Hurdles:</strong> Global variations in policy create extended approval timelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical Concerns:</strong> Sourcing embryonic stem cells, fair distribution, and cost barriers.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost and Accessibility:</strong> High production and maintenance costs can limit patient access and insurance reimbursement.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Future Directions -->
    <section>
      <h2>Future Directions</h2>

      <h3>1. Enhanced Delivery Methods</h3>
      <p>
        Innovations include biomaterial scaffolds and 3D bioprinting, which aim to improve stem cell survival, 
        integration, and targeted tissue regeneration.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Advanced Cell Programming</h3>
      <p>
        Gene editing tools like CRISPR/Cas9 and epigenetic modifications hold promise for correcting 
        genetic abnormalities and refining stem cell behavior.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Integration with Artificial Intelligence</h3>
      <p>
        Machine learning models can predict patient-specific outcomes and automate large-scale cell 
        cultivation, reducing errors and speeding up development.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Off-the-Shelf Stem Cell Products</h3>
      <p>
        Standardized allogeneic stem cell lines and robust biobanking solutions can make therapies 
        more rapidly accessible for clinical use.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Combination Therapies</h3>
      <p>
        Pairing stem cells with biomolecules, growth factors, or physical therapies could enhance 
        regenerative outcomes and broader patient recovery.
      </p>
    </section>
